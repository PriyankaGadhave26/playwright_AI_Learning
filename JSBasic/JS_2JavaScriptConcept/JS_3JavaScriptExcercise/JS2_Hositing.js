// this is conecpt of javascript Where JS Engine Create the undefined variable and assign the value  as undefined 
// to it and then execute the code. This is called as Hoisting in JavaScript. In JavaScript, we can use a variable before declaring it. This is because of hoisting. Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. This means that you can use a variable or call a function before it is declared in the code. However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations. So if you try to access a variable before it is initialized, it will return undefined.
